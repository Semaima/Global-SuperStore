# Global-SuperStore Dataset Analysis

## Overview

In this repository, I have conducted an analysis of the Superstore dataset. This README provides a summary of what I did and the purpose behind this analysis.

## Analysis

### Dataset

The Superstore dataset is a collection of sales and customer information from an e-commerce superstore. It includes data on orders, products, customers, and regions.

### What I Did

1. **Data Cleaning:** I performed data cleaning to handle missing values and ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I conducted EDA to gain insights into the data, such as identifying key trends, patterns, and correlations. This step involved data visualization and summary statistics.
